# Memoria

Our inspiration was sparked by the taunting reality of graduation, and the harsh reality of not actually remembering what we did within the last 3 to 4 years. Of course, we knew we had gone to some road trips, attended a few concerts here and there, maybe a hackathon, but we really didn't have any digital recollection of these awesome memories we had. What we really had were a few Facebook statuses buried under our statuses of glorious cats, and couple of tagged photos of some pretty not-so-glorious moments. But are those actually meaningful, intentional? Probably not. Have no fear though, we too hope to remember those special moments you had with you friends, where you could look back on it over a campfire with a couple of old friends.
